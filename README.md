# DemoX Reimagined

**DemoX Reimagined** is a next-generation showcase site designed to help AI startups, agencies, or innovators present futuristic, ethical, memory-powered digital experiences.

It was originally themed around a sacred AI brand (RAHMX) to demonstrate layout, interaction flow, and modular memory logic — but this template is **not owned by nor affiliated with RAHMX Ltd**, and **is offered as a rebrandable, customizable product**.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This demo includes:

- Dynamic homepage with fluid animations  
- AI chat teaser powered by Genkit + Gemini  
- Memory-based UX philosophy (ZamaGPT-style)  
- Interactive animated cards and vision board  
- Newsletter popup (demo only — not wired to email)  
- Modular UI components using Tailwind, ShadCN, and Lucide  
- Firebase-ready deployment structure

> 💡 **Note:** Forms and newsletter modules are visual only — not connected to a backend in this demo. Live email integrations are available in premium versions.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

```bash
Node.js v20+
npm v10+
Firebase CLI: npm install -g firebase-tools
```

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devkhan1/DemoX-Reimagined.git
cd DemoX-Reimagined
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Without the key, the AI chat preview will not function — but the rest of the site will.
